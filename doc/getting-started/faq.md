#### Is EventQL a key-value store?

#### What kind of consistency guarantees does EventQL provide?

#### Does EventQL support transactions?

#### Why AGPLv3 and not MIT/BSD?

Many man-years of research and work have gone into EventQL. Since all of the
contributors need to pay rent and feed their families the project frankly
wouldn't exist if there was no way for us to earn money around it.

However, we're deeply comitted to open source and make a pinkie promise that
we will never move the project into a closed/propietary direction. We understand
that we are deeply dependant on the trust and goodwill of the open source community.
If anything, we will reconsider to make the license more permissible in the future.

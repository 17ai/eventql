2.2.1 Inserting Records
=======================

Before you can insert records, you need to [create a table](../creating-tables/). Note that all tables
have a mandatory primary key. 

Two consecutive inserts with the same primary key value are treated as an insert
followed by an update (that is, every insert with a primary key value equal to
that of another record that already exists will replace that original record).

You can currently insert records as either JSON or Protobuf messages. Please
refer to the [documentation for your driver or API for the specifics](../../api/).

<br />

Example insert via the HTTP API:

    curl \
       -X POST \
       -d '[ { "table": "my_table", "data": { "col1": 123, "col2": "somestring" }  }  ]' \
       -H 'Authorization: Token <auth_token>' \

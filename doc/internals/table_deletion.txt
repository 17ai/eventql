questions:

 when to actually delete? what about running queruies?
 how to handle recreates?
 who is unloading the partitions?
 how are servers notified of delete?
 time delay before actual deletion?
 do we even actually delete? or wait until explicit gc?
 what about metadata servers? and metadata file?


design:

  - set table config deleted field to true
  - remove metadata servers from table config
  - let normal table lifecyle take care of removing the old partitions (or not)

pieces touched:

  - leader must not add new metadata server

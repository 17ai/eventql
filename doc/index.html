<h1>EventQL v0.4.3</h1>

EventQL is a distributed, analytical database. It allows you to store massive amounts
of structured data and explore it using SQL and other programmatic query facilities.

We have a [quick start guide](getting-started/first-steps/) for impatient people who don't like reading
documentation. For more in-depth information you are kindly referred to the remaining chapters.

<h1>EventQL v0.4.3</h1>

EventQL is a distributed, analytical database. It allows you to store massive amounts
of structured data and explore it using SQL and other programmatic query facilities.

**If you don't like reading documentation, start with the ["First Steps"](./getting-started/first-steps/) page.** It
will walk you through starting a server, inserting events and running a query
in 10 minutes. For more in-depth information you are kindly referred to the remaining chapters.
